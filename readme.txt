If you get this error, simply install the correct version of PHP curl on your system. For example, if you are running PHP version 7.0 on a Debian machine, you would run the following command to install curl: 

sudo apt-get install php7.0-curl

If you do not have control over your system, contact your admistrator and ask them to install curl.
